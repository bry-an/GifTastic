# GifTastic
This page uses the Giphy API to load gif images related to the user's current mood. A number of default moods are listed as buttons on the top from which users may select, or they may add their own. The images loaded are by default still images, but on clicking, they become animated gifs.

It also has a "I'm feeling salty" option which will only display R-rated gifs, according to Giphy's rating system. Selecting this option will reduce the number of gifs loaded because it only loads R-rated gifs. 

## How can others help
While the core functionality is present, other filter methods may enhance the page's features. Furthermore, integration with other APIs may add a more dynamic element to the page.
